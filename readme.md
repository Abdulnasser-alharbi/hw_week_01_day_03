# Functions - Problem Set

## Getting Started

Recommendation: 
- If homework is taking you more than 4 hours to complete:
    - Go to TA hours
    - Get on zoom with a classmate
    - Reach out to the instructional team
- If home work is taking you less than 4 hours to complete
    - Help someone who is stuck, teaching is a great way to learn something more in depth
    - Look for more challenges/ways to keep growing with your abilities
    
    
##  JavaScript Setup

1) In your terminal, navigate to the `misk` folder where you keep all your classwork and homework. Fork and clone this repo inside that folder.

2) `cd` inside this folder and create a javascript file named `answers.js` to record your answers.

3) Keep your answers organized! **Included a commented header for each section in your answers file.**

4) TEST YOUR WORK! Make sure that your code works
:elephant: `node name_of_your_file.js`.

5) If you're stuck on something for "too long" or get overly frustrated, make a comment and move on. Return to it later. You may find some later problems easier or need a break from what you're working on and set some fresh eyes on something you've been stuck on.

6) After each section (even if you're not fully done with it), *add* and *commit* your work.

Please use the commit messages that you see at the end of each section (modify it if you need to ie `currencyConverter almsot solved`). We will see these messages on Github. It will help us to see your progress. If you go back and fix a section, commit again with an updated message.

7) When you are done with your homework, push it to your `origin` (this is your Github) and make a pull request on our repo.

>Final note: You are not alone! Everyone else in the class is working on this as well. Send Slack messages, make a Zoom channel, or meet with the TA to discuss sticking points.

## Problems

### currencyConverter(currency, amount)

Define a function `currencyConverter` that takes two arguments an amount and a currency (USD, GBP, EGP, BD) and returns the converted version of the amount in Riyals. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript.

**Hint :**
> - 1 Riyal = 4.68 Egyptian pound 
> - 1 Riyal = 0.10 Bahraini dinar
